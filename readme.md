# Message DB Connector

This package provides a TypeScript interface to use [Message-DB](http://docs.eventide-project.org/user-guide/message-db/) in the development of [event sourced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHGkaShoyNs&ab_channel=CodeontheBeach) microservices.



## A brief aside

Building event driven systems isn't the same thing with docker and kafka.
It is a fundamentally different approach to building software and needs to approached that way.
Would you like to learn how to do that effectively?
There are two actionable steps you can take right now are to 1) purchase [Practical Microservices](https://practicalmicroservices.com/) by Ethan Garofolo and 2) If you'll pardon the shameless plug, [Connect with me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stetsonp/) and let's talk about it.
